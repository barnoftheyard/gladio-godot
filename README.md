# "gladio" : a godot fps project

This is a Godot FPS that I steadily developed after the release of Godot 4, which broke my previous project. It's arguably more well written than the last. Progressed has stalled until this point due to personal matters, however I think it boasts some features that I quite like: Featuring:
* Multiplayer (hosting and connecting)
* Damage and health
* An in-game interpreted scripting system
* Custom player and game models
* Interactive HUD and GUI elements
* Working menu

If you want to use it as a platform/starting base for your project, please let me know. This project was mostly used as a learning platform for Godot 4 as well as git. Also let me know if you want to contribute with me for your own project. I'd be happy to help, I'll figure to work in some time.
